# Crew_Scheduling_Research

• flight schedule.xlsx-Contains flight schedules (Flight ID, From, To, Aircraft type,
 Available Days)
 
 • Aircraft type.xlsx- Stores details about different aircraft types (Aircraft type,
 Min crew requirement, Max crew requirement)
 
 • Airport code.xlsx- Holds airport codes according to the airport location (Air
port code, Location)

 • salary.xlsx- Includes three types of salary details for crew members (Flight hour salary,
 Overnight stay salary, No return salary)

Conclusions

 This research aimed to develop a cost-efficient crew schedule system using Linear
 Programming (LP) and a web-based application using Django backend and
 Angular frontend. The problem of assigning crew members to flights with minimum
 operational cost and ensuring necessary constraints. In Python programming, use PuLP
 library for create robust solution to solve the crew scheduling optimization problem.
 In addition, Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, string and DateTime libraries for
 data processing to define the tours for the crew.
 Develop the Angular- Django based web application that provides managing crew
 schedules, allowing real-time scenarios and facilitating easy to access the scheduling
 data. Django and Angular offer a perfect interaction between the backend and frontend
 to give users a user-friendly experience.
 
 The key outcomes of this research,
 
 • Generate the tours according to the tour rules.
 
 • Give a path to create a linear programming model for the cost-efficient technique
 for cost-minimizing for crew scheduling.
 
 • Develop of user-friendly website for real-time crew scheduling management.

 Future Improvements
 1. Add experience levels for the crew members.
 2. Add aviation regulations and increase the number of available tours.
 3. Integrate Machine Learning models to predict demand and optimize scheduling.
 4. Expand the platform to handle additional operational constraints.
